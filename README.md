# **MAZE Game Using SDL2 and C++**

# Maze-Game

* The Goal of this project is to create a game by using a third party SDL library in 3D using raycasting!


# About SDL2
* simple DirectMedia Layer(SDL) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games including Valveâ€™s award winning catalog and many Humble Bundle games.
SDL officially supports Windows, mac 0S X, Linux, ios, and Android. 
* SDL is written in C, works natively with C++, and there are bindings available for several other languages.
* It gives an api for processing video ,audio processing, etc.
